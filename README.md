# Let's Get SASS-y

Writing CSS kinda sucks. Many times when writing it, you copy paste code alot, and there isn't a great way to throw stuff into variables to be reused. An awesome library called [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) fixes all of it!

2. get ruby
3. installation

## Getting Started (variables)
